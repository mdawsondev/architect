# Contributing

**Note**: This contribution page will remain generally incomplete until I'm ready to deliver Architect into an initial release.

Architect is in development, and there are still many choices to me made. At this point, I am designing it around tools I need or prefer while exploring JavaScript. While **Yeoman** offers a variety of build packages, it didn't answer for exactly what I wanted: *a barebones, established, modern, framework-ready building environment*. Architect differs from Yeoman in that it creats a push-ready repository and encourages best use practices on a *simple, vanilla architecture*.

The project isn't quite ready for open contributions, though I'm not discouraging you from making that decision. Plans include further modularization and expansion on the `npm` network so Architect is more accessable. It's as much a serious project as it is a learning experience, and I will be implementing a lot of various techniques and theory I learn as the project grows.
