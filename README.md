# Architect üèó

Architect is a git turnkey for building internet-ready repositories through the CLI. At the moment, it supports GitHub functionality through `git` and [hub](https://github.com/github/hub). There are plans to drop hub for a more accessable installation.

`node ./dist/app.min.js` or just run `run.bat`

This project is in development, and will eventually be moved to npm. If you'd like to contribute, please read the CONTRIBUTING document.

### Structure

* ./src/ - Uncompiled, untranspiled, raw code.
* ./dist/ - Processed code that has not been "built" into the final product.
* ./build/ - The final product; can be used without any other resources.

### History

* *v1.0.0* - Minimal but functional release to be built around.
* *v1.1.0* - Rewrote entire code to modularize application and added a git/hub validation.
* *v1.1.1* - Swap arrows for function declarations.
* *v1.1.2* - Added detailed execution plan for preferred web development setup (See: src/README.md).
* *v1.1.2a* - Dropped Mocha for Jest testing, added nodemon server support for easier checks.
* *v1.1.2b* - Convert `.ts` to TSLint-approved and compile new output.

### To-Do

* Send minified app to npm for global use.
* Compile .js into .exe for optional execution.
* Implement framework and Yeoman support for seamless setup.
